**USER-FRIENDLY SECURE SYSTEM CALL INTERFACE**

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**  
This project focuses on creating a safe system call interface with enhanced security features. It ensures that only users who are verified can run system commands and it maintains a detailed record of who accessed what. 

**Key Features**

- Dual Interface - Command-line and graphical interfaces for flexible user interaction
- Strong Authentication - Username/password verification with optional two-factor authentication
- Extensive Logging - Comprehensive audit trails for all authentication attempts and system calls
- Role-Based Access Control - User permissions based on assigned roles
- Secure System Call Execution - Protected command execution with input validation
- User-Friendly GUI - Intuitive graphical interface for easier system interaction

**PROJECT ARCHITECTURE**  
The whole project is divided into three main pieces:

1. **Authentication Module** ‚Äì This takes care of user logins and verifies their identities. 
2. **Logging Module** ‚Äì This keeps track of everything that happens, like login attempts and commands run. 
3. **System Call Handler** ‚Äì This makes sure that system commands are executed safely only by authorized users.
4. **GUI Interfac**e - Provides graphical access to all system features

These components work together to create a cohesive security framework while maintaining ease of use.

**OVERVIEW OF MODULES**  

1. **AUTHENTICATION MODULE (auth_module.cpp &amp; auth_module.h)**  
   **Purpose:**  
   The Authentication Module checks the identity of users before they can access the system. Its job is to keep credentials safe and log both successful and failed login attempts.

   **Core Functionalities:**  
   - Maintains a list of users who are allowed access (found in users.h).  
   - Uses SHA-256 to securely hash passwords.  
   - Confirms user credentials against the stored information.  

   **Files:**  
   - **auth_module.cpp:** Contains the code that handles user login processes.  
   - **auth_module.h:** Lists the functions for user authentication tasks.  
   - **users.h:** Holds user credentials in a secure manner.  

   **Key Functions:**  
   - `bool isValidUser(const std::string&amp; username, const std::string&amp; password)`: Checks if the provided username and password are correct.  
   - `std::string hashPassword(const std::string&amp; password)`: Hashes the given password with SHA-256 for security.  
   - `void logAuthentication(const std::string&amp; username, const std::string&amp; status)`: Logs the outcome of login attempts.  
   - `std::string getUserRole(const std::string&amp; username)`: Identifies the role of the user, indicating whether they are an Admin or just a regular User.  

2. **LOGGING MODULE (log_manager.cpp &amp; log_manager.h)**  
   **Purpose:**  
   The Logging Module is responsible for tracking every authentication attempt and any system calls that are made. This helps create a clear record for security reviews later.

   **Core Features:**  
   - Records when users try to log in, including the times of attempts.  
   - Logs every system call that is executed for monitoring purposes.  
   - Allows retrieval of logs whenever necessary.  
   - Tracks errors to identify what went wrong.  

   **Files:**  
   - **log_manager.cpp:** Implements the logging functionality.  
   - **log_manager.h:** Defines the logging-related functions.  
   - **auth_log.txt:** Holds records of all authentication attempts.  
   - **syscall_log.txt:** Contains records of all system calls made.  

   **Key Functions:**  
   - `void logEvent(const std::string&amp; username, const std::string&amp; event)`: Logs what system calls are executed.  
   - `void logError(const std::string&amp; errorMessage)`: Records any errors that the system encounters.  
   - `void displayLogs()`: Shows all logs of login attempts and executed commands.  

3. **SECURE SYSTEM CALL HANDLER (syscall_handler.cpp &amp; syscall_handler.h)**  
   **Purpose:**  
   This module ensures that only authenticated users can safely execute system commands.

   **Core Features:**  
   - Verifies if the user is authenticated before allowing them to run system calls.  
   - Executes commands in a safe way to prevent misuse.  
   - Logs every command that's executed for security monitoring.  
   - Ensures that permission to access features is based on the user's role.  
   - Blocks unauthorized commands from going through.  

   **Files:**  
   - **syscall_handler.cpp:** Responsible for securely executing system calls.  
   - **syscall_handler.h:** Lists functions related to managing system calls.  
   - **syscall_log.txt:** Stores logs of all commands that were executed.  

   **Key Functions:**  
   - `void secureSystemCall(const std::string&amp; username, const std::string&amp; command)`: Handles the secure execution of commands.  
   - `bool isAuthorizedUser(const std::string&amp; username)`: Checks if the user is permitted to carry out the commands.  
   - `void logSystemCall(const std::string&amp; username, const std::string&amp; command)`: Keeps a security log of executed commands.  

4. **GUI Interface**
**Purpose**
 Provides user-friendly graphical access to all system features

**Key Features:**

- Intuitive login screen with 2FA support
- Dashboard for system monitoring
- Command execution panel with history
- Real-time log viewer
- User management interface (admin only)

**Key Components:**

- auth_screen.py - Handles login and 2FA verification
- dashboard.py - Main user interface after authentication
